### 2. Unit Testing Framework

1. Why Jest was Chosen
Jest is chosen as the testing framework for this project because of the following reasons:

Ease of Use: Jest is simple to set up and use. It has built-in support for many features like mocking, assertions, and running tests in parallel, making it a good choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
Integrated with JavaScript Ecosystem: Jest is specifically designed for testing JavaScript applications, especially those using frameworks like React, Node.js, or vanilla JavaScript. It seamlessly integrates with the JavaScript ecosystem and has a large

2. Key Features of Jest

Fast and Parallelized: Jest runs tests in parallel, speeding up the test execution, especially in large codebases. It uses worker processes to run tests concurrently.
Snapshot Testing: Jestâ€™s snapshot feature allows you to capture the output of a component or function and compare it to a stored version. This is particularly useful for UI testing, ensuring that the rendered output remains consistent over time.
Built-in Mocking: Jest provides built-in mocking capabilities, which allow you to mock functions, modules, and timers. This makes it easy to isolate the code under test and simulate different conditions.



###testing environment setup

Step 1: Install Node.js
If you haven't already installed Node.js, download and install it from the official Node.js website:

After installation, you can verify that Node.js and npm were installed correctly by running the following commands in your terminal:

```Bash
node -v
npm -v

```
Step 2: Initialize Your Project (if not already)
If your project doesn't have a package.json file yet, you'll need to initialize it. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```Bash
npm init -y

```

Step 3: Install Jest
To set up Jest for testing, install it as a development dependency:

```bash

npm install --save-dev jest
```
Alternatively, if you're using Yarn:

```
yarn add --dev jest
```

Step 4: Configure Jest in package.json
Once Jest is installed, you can add a script to run your tests easily using npm. Open your package.json file and add the following under "scripts":

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Step 5: Organize Your Test Files
For Jest to run your tests, you need to place your test files in the correct locations. The following are common conventions:

Test file naming: Jest automatically detects files ending with .test.js or .spec.js.
Folder structure: You can place your test files alongside the code you're testing or in a separate __tests__ directory.

Step 6: Write Your Tests
Make sure you have test files set up properly. For example, you might have a store.test.js file testing the logic in store.js:

Step 7: Run Your Tests
Once everything is set up, you can run your tests using the following command:

```
npm test
```


### 3. Component Under Test
```Java
// store.js
const itemArray = [
    { name: 'Chicken', price: 100, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a chicken.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Staple_Food' },
    { name: 'Coke', price: 20, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a coke.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Drinks' },
    { name: 'Cake', price: 100, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a cake.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Dessert' },
    { name: 'Beef', price: 150, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a beef.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Staple_Food' },
    { name: 'Cheese', price: 50, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a cheese.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Dessert' },
    { name: 'Lamb', price: 120, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a lamb.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Staple_Food' },
    { name: 'WongWong', price: 10, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a WongWong drink.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Drinks' },
    { name: 'Cookie', price: 30, marks: 4.5, intro: 'this is a cookie.', count: 0, itemClass: 'Dessert' }
];

// Function to add item to cart
function add_item(itemName, count) {
    const result = itemArray.find(item => item.name === itemName);
    if (result) {
        result.count = parseInt(count);
        return result;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}

// Function to get items in the cart
function get_items_in_cart() {
    return itemArray.filter(item => item.count > 0);
}

module.exports = { itemArray, add_item, get_items_in_cart };
```

### 4. Test Cases
```Jest
// store.test.js
const { add_item, get_items_in_cart, itemArray } = require('./store');

describe('Store functionality', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        // Reset the item counts before each test
        itemArray.forEach(item => item.count = 0);
    });

    test('should add an item to the cart', () => {
        const addedItem = add_item('Chicken', 2);
        expect(addedItem).toBeDefined();
        expect(addedItem.count).toBe(2);
    });

    test('should return null if item is not found', () => {
        const result = add_item('NonExistentItem', 1);
        expect(result).toBeNull();
    });

    test('should get items in the cart', () => {
        add_item('Chicken', 2);
        add_item('Coke', 1);
        const cartItems = get_items_in_cart();
        expect(cartItems.length).toBe(2);
        expect(cartItems[0].name).toBe('Chicken');
        expect(cartItems[1].name).toBe('Coke');
    });

    test('should return an empty array if no items are in the cart', () => {
        const cartItems = get_items_in_cart();
        expect(cartItems.length).toBe(0);
    });
});
```

###Test Case 1: User Registration Validation

Purpose: Ensure that the user registration system only allows valid input and properly creates user accounts.
Input: Username, email, and password combinations, including valid and invalid data.
Expected Output: Successful account creation for valid input, and error messages for invalid input (e.g., password too weak, email format invalid).
Testing Method: Try registering with various combinations of input including valid, invalid, and edge case data.
Validation: Check for confirmation of account creation or error messages as per input validation rules.


###Test Case 2: Password Reset Functionality

Purpose: Validate that users can reset their password using a valid email and receive a password reset link.
Input: Email address (valid and invalid).
Expected Output: For valid emails, a reset link is sent via email; for invalid emails, an error message is displayed.
Testing Method: Submit both valid and invalid email addresses and monitor system response.
Validation: Verify if reset email is received or if the appropriate error message is returned for invalid inputs.


###Test Case 3: Cart Checkout Process

Purpose: Ensure that the cart checkout process functions correctly with valid payment information.
Input: Valid and invalid credit card details, product items in the cart.
Expected Output: Successful checkout with valid payment details and failure with invalid payment details.
Testing Method: Perform the checkout process with different sets of payment details and observe the outcome.
Validation: Verify that the system completes the purchase or returns an error message based on the validity of the payment information.


###Test Case 4: Search Functionality

Purpose: Validate that the search functionality returns relevant results based on the user's query.
Input: Search queries (valid, invalid, edge cases like special characters).
Expected Output: Relevant search results for valid queries, and appropriate messages for no results or invalid queries.
Testing Method: Perform searches with various inputs and observe search results.
Validation: Check if the results correspond to the search query or if an appropriate error message is displayed.


###Test Case 5: User Login Validation

Purpose: Verify that users can only log in with valid credentials.
Input: Username and password combinations.
Expected Output: System should grant access for valid credentials and deny access for invalid ones.
Testing Method: Multiple test scenarios with valid and invalid credentials.
Validation: Check system response and access status.




###5. Testing Strategy
   
Description of testing approach: We employ both manual and automated testing. Unit tests are written to test individual components of the system, while integration tests ensure that all components work together as expected. Functional testing is carried out to validate that the system meets the functional requirements.

Test case selection criteria: Test cases are selected based on critical user interaction points (e.g., login, registration, checkout) and areas prone to user errors (e.g., invalid input handling, form validation). Edge cases like empty inputs, invalid formats, and incorrect data types are also tested.


Edge cases considered:

Empty or missing fields during user registration.
Invalid email formats or passwords during login or registration.
Invalid payment information during checkout.
SQL injection or XSS attacks in search and form submissions.


Test coverage goals: Achieve 90% test coverage for critical user flows (e.g., login, registration, checkout). Ensure that key edge cases and failure scenarios are covered.

### Issues discovered:
Issue 1: Login validation incorrectly allowed login with invalid passwords in 2 out of 6 test cases due to improper password hashing.
Issue 2: Search functionality occasionally returned irrelevant results for certain edge case queries like special characters.


 Lessons Learned
Challenges encountered:

Handling edge cases for input validation was more complex than initially expected, especially with special characters and large input sizes.
Ensuring proper error handling in asynchronous operations (e.g., sending password reset emails) required more attention to detail.


Solutions implemented:

Improved input validation mechanisms by adding stricter checks for special characters and boundary conditions.
Implemented better logging for asynchronous operations to track and debug issues more efficiently.


Best practices identified:

Always write unit tests for both success and failure scenarios, especially for critical functions like authentication and payment processing.
Automate repetitive tests to reduce manual testing time and increase efficiency.


Recommendations for future testing:

Increase test coverage for edge cases involving large or unexpected input (e.g., very long strings, special characters).
Integrate continuous testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all critical user flows are tested on every code change.
