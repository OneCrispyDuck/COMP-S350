This diagram will provide a visual representation of the main components and their interactions. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Identify the main components:
Mobile App (iOS and Android)
API Gateway
Authentication Service
User Service
Restaurant Service
Order Service
Payment Service
Notification Service
Database(s)
Determine the relationships between components:
Consider how data and requests flow between services
Identify which services communicate directly and which go through the API Gateway
Choose a diagramming tool:
You can use tools like Draw.io, Lucidchart, or Microsoft Visio
For this example, let's assume we're using Draw.io
Create the diagram:
Step 1: Set up the canvas

Open Draw.io and start a new diagram
Choose a blank canvas
Step 2: Add the Mobile App

Drag a "Mobile" shape to the left side of the canvas
Label it "Mobile App (iOS/Android)"
Step 3: Add the API Gateway

Place a "Gateway" shape to the right of the Mobile App
Label it "API Gateway"
Connect it to the Mobile App with an arrow
Step 4: Add Core Services

Add rectangles for each core service: Authentication, User, Restaurant, Order, Payment, and Notification
Arrange them in a logical grouping to the right of the API Gateway
Connect each service to the API Gateway with bidirectional arrows
Step 5: Add the Database layer

Place database symbols at the bottom of the diagram
You might have separate databases for different services or a shared database
Connect the databases to the relevant services
Step 6: Add External Services

Include shapes for external services like Payment Gateway and Push Notification Service
Connect them to the relevant internal services
Step 7: Add a Load Balancer

Place a load balancer symbol in front of the API Gateway to represent distributed traffic
Step 8: Include a Cache layer

Add a caching component (e.g., Redis) connected to relevant services for improved performance
Step 9: Add Security Components

Include a firewall symbol to show security measures
Add an SSL/TLS certificate symbol near the API Gateway
Step 10: Include Monitoring and Logging

Add shapes to represent monitoring and logging services
Step 11: Add legends and notes

Create a legend explaining the symbols used
Add notes to clarify any complex interactions or important details
Step 12: Review and Refine

Ensure all components are connected logically
Verify that the diagram accurately represents your system
Adjust layout for clarity and readability
