Software Engineering: Year 3 CompSci Group Project.

## Food Ordering & Tracking App

## Overview
Food Ordering and Tracking App:
This is a Software Engineering Project hosted by the Hong Kong Metropolitan Univeristy under the Bachelors of Science for Computer Science and Engineering majors.
The scope of the project is for a team to practice the scope of engineering and it's requriements.
Here the team is tasked with creating a 'Food Ordering & Tracking App', the team will pracice on the following:
- Organisation
- Resource requirments
- User Requirments
- Team & Formatting/Programming etiquettes
- Documentation, testing and attempted deployment

Note: A full working prototype of the product is not a must, but rather this is the learning and practice of the processes of Software engineering.

- The group will develop software following appropriate software engineering process.
- By software engineering process, the report will contain some or all these activities:
a) Software specification/requirement engineering
b) Software design
c) Software implementation
d) Software validation/testing
e) Software evolution
